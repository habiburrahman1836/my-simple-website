        <p>The name of Noakhali District comes from the town of Noakhali (নোয়াখালী),
             which was the former headquarters of the old district. 
             It is a compound of two words; Noa (meaning new in Noakhailla)
             and Khali (a diminutive of khal meaning canal). The history behind its naming is 
             traced back to a canal that was dug in the 1660s in response to devastating floods 
             which had affected the area's agricultural activities. The canal ran from the Dakatia 
             through Ramganj, Sonaimuri and Chowmuhani, to divert water flow to the junction of the 
             Meghna River and Feni River. After its excavation, 
             locals began calling it "Noakhali" (a new small canal) 
             and a town with this name emerged around it in Sudharam.</p>
